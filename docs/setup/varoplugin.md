# Notice
Upon startup, this plugin will automatically download dependencies from [maven central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/).  
It also contains an auto updater that regularly checks for new versions by contacting the [spiget API](https://spiget.org/). It does however NOT download new versions without user interaction.  
This plugin uploads anonymized usage data to [bstats](https://bstats.org/). The resulting statistics are publicly available [here](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Varo/6639). This feature can be disabled by a server administrator in the `plugins/bStats/config.yml` configuration file.
