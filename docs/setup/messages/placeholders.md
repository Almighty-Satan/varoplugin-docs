## Team Placeholders
Team placeholders always require a prefix. This can either be `team-` to get the current player's team, or `top-team-` to get a ranked team (see [Top Player/Team Placeholders](#top-playerteam-placeholders)).

| Placeholder | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The team's name |
| `displayname` | The team's display-name (includes color code and `#`) |
| `id` | The team's internal id |
| `kills` | The total number of kills that the members of this team have made |
| `lives` | The number of team-lives this team has left |

## Top Player/Team Placeholders
All player/team placeholders can be used with either the prefix `top-player-`/`top-team-` to select the top player/team.
The first argument is the desired ranking, where `0` means the best player/team.
The second argument is returned in case no player/team with the desired ranking is found.

Examples:
- `<top-player-name:0:->` will evaluate to the best player's name or `-` if there is no best player.  
- `<top-player-uuid:1:XXX>` will evaluate to the second-best player's UUID or `XXX` if there is no second-best player
- `<top-team-kills:3:->` will evaluate to the third-best team's kills or `-` if there is no third-best team
