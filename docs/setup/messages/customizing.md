# Configuring Messages
Messages can be configured in the message configuration files located in `plugin/Varo/messages`.
The default language can be configured in the main configuration file. If `language.allowOther` is enabled, the plugin will automatically detect a players locale when they first join and set their language accordingly. A player can manually change their language using the `/language` command.
